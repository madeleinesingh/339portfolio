		<p>Welcome! At first, I planned on making a fitness guide, but I realized that physical health is so much more than just exercise; it can be influenced by your mental health, too.</p>
		<p>Wellness is the act of practicing healthy habits on a daily basis to attain better physical and mental health outcomes, so that instead of just surviving, you're thriving. To understand the significance of wellness, it's important to understand how it's linked to health.</p>

		  <p>On this page is the Wellness Wheel, a graphic commonly utilized by the University of Michigan. In this site, I've decided to focus mainly on Physical and Emotional/Mental wellness. Throughout this website, Iâ€™ve included some of my favorite wellness tips, including a 30-day challenge and a list of my favorite workout spots in Ann Arbor. Disclaimer: I am NOT a health professional nor fitness professional - this is just something that I enjoy talking about, and that other people may benefit from. Enjoy!</p>
